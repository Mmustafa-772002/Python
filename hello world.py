# this is commet in the python 
# variable : varible is the data containeter in that we can store the data statically or dynamically
# static variable : static variable is the variable in that we can store the data statically
# dynamic variable : dynamic variable is the variable in that we can store the data dynamically
# example of static variable
charachter_name = "mike tison"
print("my name is " + charachter_name)
# this is also called as concatenation 
print(charachter_name.upper()) # output : MIKE
# this is also called as upper case it is used to convert the string into upper case 
print(charachter_name.lower()) # output : mike
# this is also called as lower case it is used to convert the string into lower case
print(charachter_name.isupper()) # output : False
# this is also called as isupper it is used to check the string is in upper case or not
print(charachter_name.islower()) # output : False
# this is also called as islower it is used to check the string is in lower case or not
print(charachter_name.upper().isupper()) # output : True
# this is also called as upper and isupper it is used to convert the string into upper case and check the string is in upper case or not
print(len(charachter_name)) # output : 10
# this is also called as len it is used to find the length of the string

# output : my name is mike

# example of dynamic variable
my_age = input("enter your age : ")
print("my age is " + my_age)

# output : my age is 35

# varible types : there are 3 types of variable in python
# 1. string variable
# 2. integer variable
# 3. float variable
# 4. boolean type
# example of string variable

print(name)

#output : mike

# example of integer variable
age = 35
print(age)

# output : 35

# example of float variable
height = 5.8
print(height)

# output : 5.8

# example of boolean
male = True
print(male)

#output : True
